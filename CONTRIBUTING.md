# How do I contribute?

- Assign yourself one of the issues
- Fork the repository
- Do the work
- Create a Pull Request

## Some notes

- PR's will be reviewed within 2 business days.
- If you don't answer within 2 business days, we might just do needed changes ourselves or do the task ourselves.
- The issues are just suggestions what to work on and to make it visible what's already being worked on. If you already know how to contribute, go ahead.
- PR's should ideally be merged within a day and not live longer than 7 days
- If you contribute more regularly, we will give you access to the repo, so that you don't need to work on a fork.
