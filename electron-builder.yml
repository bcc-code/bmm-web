  recommends:
    # Most XDG supporting desktop distros will use a trigger installed by this package to automatically register the URI scheme handling.
    # However, the app RUNs without it, and distros are free to provide a different mechanism (or let the user handle it manually).
    # Documentation states: (https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-relationships.html)
    # > This declares a strong, but not absolute, dependency.
    # > The Recommends field should list packages that would be found together with this one in all but unusual installations.
